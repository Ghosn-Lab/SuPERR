# In the manuscript "Comprehensive multi-omics single-cell data integration reveals greater heterogeneity in the human immune system" we refer to a Cell Misclassification Statistic  (CMS). CMS is applied exactly as in our recent publication "Data Matrix Normalization and Merging Strategies Minimize Batch-specific Systemic Variation in scRNA-Seq Data", which is freely available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.456898v1

# This document is intended to guide the user through the steps needed to reproduce the CMS calculation.

# CMS

# The Cell Misclassification Statistic (CMS) is a scoring metric we apply to evaluate whether cells in a single-cell RNA-seq experiment retain the same classification variable (e.g. cell type, function, state) between replicate dataset analyses.
# CMS is presented here exactly as in our complementary work "Data Matrix Normalization and Merging Strategies Minimize Batch-specific Systemic Variation in scRNA-Seq Data" which is freely available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.456898v1.

## Software Requirements

# To calculate a CMS score we need only an up-to-date version of base R (tested on R 4.0.5 running on MacOS 11.5)
# No special installation is required.

## Example ##
#############

# To calculate a CMS we will need a dataframe "x" containing the cell barcodes and the classifications which we wish to test (one row for each cell).
# We provide a small example using demo data here:
# The expected runtime for this demo is less than one second.

x <- data.frame(ID_1 = c("B_Cells", "NK_CD56Hi", "NK", "T_CD8", "T_CD4", "NK", "NK", "Monocyte"),
                ID_2 = c("B_Cells", "NK_CD56Hi", "NK", "NK", "T_CD4", "NK", "NK", "Monocyte"))

head(x)

# Find which IDs from workflow 1 match IDs from workflow 2
match <- x[, 'ID_1'] == x[, 'ID_2']

# Divide the number of matches by the total number of cells
CMS <- sum(match, na.rm = T) / length(match)

# Invert the score so that 1 is 100% mismatch and 0 is 100% match
CMS <- 1 - CMS
print(CMS)

# In this example, 7 of 8 cells (87.5%) change classification between analyses (represented by ID_1 and ID_2).
# The calculated CMS is 0.125, or to say that a 12.5% rate of misclassification is occurring between analyses.


# CMS can be compared between analyses to evaluate the cell classification fidelity of a given dataset analysis workflow.
