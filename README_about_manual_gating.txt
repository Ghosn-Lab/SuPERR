In the manuscript "Comprehensive multi-omics single-cell data integration reveals greater heterogeneity in the human immune system" we refer to Manual Gating using a customized strategy of biaxal plots, which was implemented in MATLAB. Following the codes 'Anti_seq_manual_gating_BM.m' and 'Anti_seq_manual_gating_PBMC.m', one could easily reproduce the results by drawing polygons. Hope you will have fun!
